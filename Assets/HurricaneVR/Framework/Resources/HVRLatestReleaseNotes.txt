HVRHandGrabber
	Pusher [Box Collider] & PushoutTime [float] : optional box collider (generated automatically if not supplied) that will grow from zero to max size over PushoutTime.
		Used when Hand goes to retrieve an object to ensure the hand doesn't get stuck in collision geometry.
		Used after overlap clearance with a dropped object times out and is still overlapping to push the stuck object out of the hand.
		Used after release if collisions were disabled on the hand while holding an object.
		Users can start the push sequence by calling StartPushing if desired.
	Pull Sequence Changes:
		If pulling a grabbed object to the hand times out while trying to orient to the pose position, the hand will go retrieve
		the object if the remaining angle difference is greater than "Move Threshold". This should help prevent objects getting stuck
		when the fixed joint is created with the hand.
		

HVRGrabbable:
	OverrideMaxDistanceBehaviour & MaxDistanceBehaviour to override what happens after the hand gets to far from the controller.
	LinkedGrabbables: additional grabbables that might be on the same rigidbody to consider it a two hand grab.
	InstantHandPose: If true, the removed object will instantly be orienated based on it's pose. Large sockets in demo scene enabled.
	GrabBehaviour: override the Hand's "Pull or Hand Grab's" behaviour. (Default, PullToHand, HandRetrieves)
	FinalJointMaxAngle defaulted to 15.
	FinalJointTimeout defaulted to .25 seconds.

HVRSocket
	DisableCollision: If false socketed objects maintain their collision, used only for static or kinematic rb sockets.
	InstantHandPose: If true, the removed object will instantly be orienated based on it's pose. Large sockets in demo scene enabled.

VRIK Automation Tool now ready for use.

HVRGrabbable - linked socket setter made public.
Fixed HexaV4 Integration Rig misssing pelvis collider material.
HVRInputManager - will now just warn if GrabHaptics is not supplied, and will not auto create default settings.

2.7

Fixed an issue with the input manager where OVRInputs wouldn't work if the controller connected late.
Fixed an issue where sockets with overlapping triggers would infinitely grab the socket out of it's neighbor.
HVRGrabbable - OriginalCollisionMode, WasGravity, Was Kinematic setters set to public so they can be modified by user while grabbed.
Barebones Scene - added OpenXR Rig variant.
Tweaked hand inertia tensor and default wrist strength.


Haptics Updates:
	Haptics fields removed from HVRForceGrabber and HVRHandGrabber and moved to HVRGrabHaptics scriptable object that can be set on the HVRInputManager
	InputSystem Controller updated for OpenXR 1.3 where they finally updated full haptic functionality which allows haptic frequency adjustments.
	HVRGunBase: Added HVRGunHaptics Scriptable Object and HapticsGrabbable field that let's you decide which other grabbable on the gun will vibrate the hand holding it.
	HVRGrabbableImpactHaptics & HVRHandImpactHaptics - adds collision haptics to grabbable and the physics hands. Uses HVRImpactHaptics scriptable object for haptics settings.
 	HVRInputManager - Updated with HVRGrabHaptics settings reference.
	Example prefabs updated with new haptic components.

New Scriptable Objects:

	HVRImpactHaptics:
		Timeout : time before another haptic vibration is allowed since the last.
		Sqr Mag Threshold : post collision velocity threshold required to vibrate.
		Amp Curve: animation curve used to scale haptic amplitude by collision force.
		Max Force: Collision force is divided by this value and fed into the amp curve.
		Duration: Haptic Duration
		Frequency: Haptic Frequency
		
	HVRGunHaptics:
		DryFire: haptic when pulling trigger with empty gun.
		Fire: when the gun shoots.
		Trigger Released: when trigger drops below pull threshold.
		Trigger Squeezed: constant haptics while trigger is being pulled.
		Cocking Handle Eject: when eject threshold is met.
		Cocking Handle Chambered Round: when chambered round threshold hit.
		Cocking Handle Released: when cocking handle is released.
		Ammo Socketed: when a magazine enters the mag socket.
		Ammo Socket Released: when mag socket releases it's object.
	
	
	HVRGrabHaptics:
		Hand Grab: when hand joint attaches
		Hand Release: when dropping object
		Hand Hover: when hand hovers and object
		Force Grab: when force grabber starts grabbing
		Force Hover: when force grabber hovers

	-PhysicsPoserFallback set to false on dummy mag grab to fix grab indicator used.
	-Example guns updated.


2.6

Major improvements to dynamic pose grabbing:
	- When force grabbing the palm will align towards the collider to help prevent finger overlap.
	- Dynamic grab now works with the "Hand Grabs" feature where the hand can move to the object.
	- Fingers now smoothly bend to their dynamic pose instead of snapping immediately
	- Grabbable objects now smoothly come into the hand instead of snapping immediately
	
Hand Pose Editor: 
 	- Updated to show the bone gizmos while preview hands are active, even if another object is selected.	
	- Issues with gizmos not showing up when more than one inspector is open should be fixed.

New VRIK Setup Window - tutorial to follow
New Custom Hand Setup Window - tutorial to follow 

HVRHandGrabber:
	- CloneHandModel will no longer clone the skinned mesh renderer, it will instead create an invisible hand clone for collision purposes only leaving the original intact without colliders.
	- Tweaked default throwing velocity factors on tech demo hands.
	- Fixed layer reset after a dynamic grab when all collider layers weren't the same to begin with.
	- DynamicPoseIndicatorMode - chose behaviour of grab indicators when dynamic posing would occur: (None, Transform Position, Palm Position)
	- DynamicPoseIndicator - grab indicator override when hovering with dynamic posing
	- Hand Collision with a released object will re-enable immediately for objects without a rigidbody, or a rigidbody that's kinematic.
	- Fixed an issue where BreakDistance was checking too early before the grab joint was made.
	- Grip grab being active will prevent Hovering a grabbable.
	
HVRGrabbable: 
	- ParentHandModel now defaulted to false
	- RigidBody can now be assigned, useful for compound objects like guns with secondary holds.

	- Colliders / AdditionalIgnoreColliders changed to lists instead of arrays for runtime modification.
